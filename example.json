// FBX export on Max 2017 - FBX Version 2014/2015
// Include Camera, must have a Camera Target.  Free Camera not supported.
// Both FBX Filename, Mesh, Material and texture need to be the same name.
// Multi Map Materials supported.  But only 1 Texture supported per FBX.
// FBX File Units, must be in Inches.  Anything else will give unpredictable results.
// Set HotSpots scale to 150 units.  Make sure the Hotspots are not on the mesh, slight above it.
